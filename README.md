# list\_mountable\_stuff
Lists devices that can be mounted. For more info, see the Documentation at top of "list\_mountable\_stuff.c".

# NOTE:
Right now, it needs root privileges to work (You don't `sudo` as prefix, you can do that btw. What I mean is, it's executable needs `suid` bit on). I am thinking about implementing **polkit** functionality but I don't know how to do that ðŸ˜¬. *I am still learning*
